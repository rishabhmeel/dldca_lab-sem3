; Each rect is 4 consecutive qwords: x1, y1, x2, y2
; Treat each rect's x-extent and y-extent as OPEN intervals (x1, x2) and
; (y1, y2) -- a rect does not include its own boundary. Two rects overlap
; iff both their x-intervals and y-intervals intersect as open intervals:
;
;   a.x1 < b.x2  AND  a.x2 > b.x1  AND  a.y1 < b.y2  AND  a.y2 > b.y1
;
; (Rects that only touch along an edge, with no interior overlap, do NOT
; count as overlapping)
